# Quebec Wildfire Project
###The year 2023 is the season where the most area burned in Canadaâ€™s history. About 5% of entire forest are of Canada was burned. Even though the number of wildfires has decreased since 80s, the area burned in Canada has increased. Consequently, Quebec affected in the same way.

###Our project aims to create an alert system that analyses weather data so that firefighters, local governments and local people can be prepared beforehand if there is a risk of forest fire.
